- **Difficulty Curve:** When player reach a score of 200 points objects start to fall faster and more often.


###  Dynamics
- Players balance **risk and reward**: chase tuna for points while avoiding sticks.

### Aesthetics 
Experience the endurance of an albatross providing for its mate while soaring above the Pacific Coast Highway.

- **Challeneg:** Test reflexes and precision timing.
- **Sensation:** The thrill of weaving through falling hazards.
- **Survival Tension:** Every hit matters as health drains.
